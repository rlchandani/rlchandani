Hi, I'm Rohit Lal Chandani!

I am a Senior Software Engineer working for Amazon Retail, where I focus on developing services to enable sister teams send messages to customers which are transactional in nature, that is, sent as a result of an action taken by - or on behalf of - the customer.

As a professional, I strongly encourage and promote using AWS due to its ease of use, availability of a diverse array of tools, unlimited server capacity, reliability and security.

Outside my 9-5 job, I also enjoy working on personal projects which range from developing websites, telegram bots, automated financial portfolio management and productivity tools like Chrome/Mozilla browser extension.

For low budget personal projects, I use AWS in combination with Firebase.

Before joining Amazon, I was a Data Engineer at Meta, Amdocs and started my professional career with Infosys in 2009. I graduated from Pune University in Maharashtra, India with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology.

Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
- Socializing with friends and family
- Hiking
- Travelling
